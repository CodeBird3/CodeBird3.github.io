# Hello and Welcome to My Profile!

I'm glad you could drop by!

I'm a singer-songwriter/actress who has also recently transitioned into front end web development. This transition into web development was inspired by my dream of being able to build my own website from scratch instead of solely relying on templates.

## What I Can Do:

___

HTML5 CSS3 SCSS JS/ES6 jQuery React MERN Swift

## Fun Fact!

- I have approximately 100 tropical plants ranging from easy-to-take-care-of (Pothos, Philodendron) to more challenging plants (Fiddle Leaf Fig, Cordyline).
- I was an extra on Degrassi
